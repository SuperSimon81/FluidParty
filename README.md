A real-time eulerian fluid simulation with vorticity confinement in C#

Adapted from Daniel Shiffmans (https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/132-fluid-simulation.html) tutorial on fluid dynamics which in turn is based on Jos Stams Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games (http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf). 

Vorticity confinement adapted from https://github.com/983/Fluid-Simulation
